# Composition vs Inheritance

## Inheritance
### "Is a" relation
### Create superclass in order to remove duplication
### Issues
#### Multiple hierarchies
##### Introduce concept duplication
##### Name clash
#### Multiple inheritance
##### Not supported in many languages
##### Name clash

## Composition
### "Has a" relation
### Including objects from other class

## Questions to the team
### What if we add a method to the superclass that is not relevant to all subclasses?
### What if we add a method to the server that is not relevant to all clients?
### What's the difference between interface and abstract class?
### Which is easier to read and understand?
