# You Arent Gonna Need It

## Implement what you actually need
### Do not overengineer

## Not what you foresee that you will need
### You don't need it
### Is quite different
### Supports KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!)

## Reasons
### Save time
### Code is better

## Example
### A: "why do you want to add it now?"
### B: "it will save time later"
#### "We will be able to do less work overall, at the cost of doing more work now"
### Doing more now is a bad thing when you already have too much to do
### high chance that you won't need it after all
### you'll need to rewrite or fix it once you do need it
### B: "I know how to do it right now, and later I might not."
### A: "You're telling me that this class you're writing is so complex that even you won't be able to maintain it?"

## If it happen
### Waste time overall
### Prevent yourself from adding things that you do need right now

## In XP
### Try to make easy to add functionality in the future
#### Refactoring
#### Testing
#### Remove duplication
#### Keep the system small and understandable
