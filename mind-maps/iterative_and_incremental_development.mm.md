# Iterative and Incremental Development

## The Analysis
### You have some idea of what the product is supposed to do
### Each new version contradicts the previous
### Analysis can go on forever, it has to be stopped at some point

## The Design
### The analysis is wrong
#### You need to go back but the analysis phase is over
#### Hack the design
### Requirements change
#### Hack the design

## The Implementation
### Design is lacking
#### You need to redesign but the design phase is over.
### LOL
#### Your boss hires a consultant to build tools to count the number of lines of code that are being produced
#### Are you sure your comment blocks are big enough?
#### No line of code is to be longer than 20 characters -> Split
#### 50-hour workweek
#### Mandatory Saturdays
#### 65-hour workweek

## Waterfall produces no reliable data with which to manage the development process
